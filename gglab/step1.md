We will create Compartment and VCN ...


A compartment is a collection of cloud assets, like compute instances, load balancers, databases, etc. By default, a root compartment was created for you when you created your tenancy (ie when you registered for the trial account). It is possible to create everything in the root compartment, but Oracle recommends that you create sub-compartments to help manage your resources more efficiently.

Virtual Cloud Networks

Introduction: 

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute lets you create multiple Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs). These VCNs will contain the security lists, compute instances, load balancers and many other types of network assets.

Be sure to review Overview of Networking to gain a full understanding of the network components and their relationships, or take a look at this video:
