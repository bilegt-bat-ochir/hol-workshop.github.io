We will create Compartment and VCN ...


A compartment is a collection of cloud assets, like compute instances, load balancers, databases, etc. By default, a root compartment was created for you when you created your tenancy (ie when you registered for the trial account). It is possible to create everything in the root compartment, but Oracle recommends that you create sub-compartments to help manage your resources more efficiently.
